  Project Title: Room Furniture Store Locator and E-commerce Platform
Project Goals:

    Optimize Customer Access: Enable customers to locate and shop from the nearest Room Furniture Store based on their current location.
    Personalized Experience: Provide customized delivery and stock information based on the closest store.
    Enhanced In-store Pickup Options: Allow customers to purchase online and pick up items from a nearby store, making the process faster and more convenient.

Core Features:
1. Location-Based Store Finder

    Gebeta Map API Integration: Use the Gebeta Map Location API to determine the user’s current location and calculate the nearest store.
    Store Finder Widget: Display the closest store’s location, distance, and estimated travel time, with options for map view, directions, and store hours.
    Multi-Store Support: For users near multiple stores, suggest a ranked list based on distance, product availability, and delivery time.

2. Localized Inventory & Stock Levels

    Each store can update its local inventory in real time, allowing users to check if desired products are available nearby.
    If an item is out of stock locally, the platform could show the next closest store with availability.

3. Enhanced Delivery & Pickup Options

    In-store Pickup: Customers can select products for in-store pickup at their nearest location.
    Fast Shipping from Nearby Stores: If a store has an item in stock, the app can prioritize shipping from that location for faster delivery.

4. Geolocation-Driven Promotions

    Localized Discounts: Display store-specific promotions and discounts based on the user’s nearest location.
    Events & Notifications: Notify users about special events (like sales or in-store activities) at nearby stores.

5. User-Friendly UI/UX Design

    Intuitive Map Interface: A sleek, intuitive interface showing stores and product info via map overlays and store pins.
    Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure that location services and store navigation features work seamlessly on mobile devices.

6. Cross-Sell & Up-Sell Opportunities

    Related Product Suggestions: Based on selected products and store availability, recommend complementary items in stock at the same or nearby stores.

Technical Considerations:

    Frontend: React with responsive design for mobile-first experience.
    Backend: Node.js for handling store locations, inventory sync, and user sessions.
    APIs: Gebeta Map Location API for geolocation, inventory API for stock data from multiple stores, and e-commerce API for transaction handling.

Potential Challenges:

    Geolocation Accuracy: Ensuring the Gebeta Map API accurately reflects the user’s current location.
    Real-time Stock Updates: Keeping inventory updated across all stores in real-time.
    Scalability: Supporting the platform as store locations or e-commerce traffic increase.

This project could make Room Furniture Store a top option for customers who prefer an integrated online and offline shopping experience.

- Product Reviews and Ratings

  - Problem: Lack of user reviews and ratings can make it difficult for potential customers to trust the quality of the products.
  - Solution: Integrate a review and rating system where previous buyers can leave feedback on the products. Highlight top-rated products and respond to reviews to show active customer service.
